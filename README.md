This repository consists of three basic codes.
1. Zero-shot FLAN-T5 small model analysing its score - (FLAN-T5 small ZS)
2. Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 small model analysing its score - (FLAN-T5 small FT)
3. Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 base model analysing its score - (FLAN-T5 base)

All the file consists of code to clone dataset from Hugging Face library but still attaching the dataset here if incase of future use.
